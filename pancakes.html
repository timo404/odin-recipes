    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Serve these pancakes with butter and syrup, or up the ante with toppings such as sprinkles, chopped bittersweet chocolate, and sliced or chopped fruit for a perfect breakfast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, for greasing, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup or fruit, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step1</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
        Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.
