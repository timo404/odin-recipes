    <img src="/img/has.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This breakfast hash will get your day off to a great start! Served on a bed of fresh spinach, the sweet potatoes, apples, onions, and bacon make a delicious base for a lightly fried or poached egg. Add another egg, if youâ€™re really hungry!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>5 slices low-sodium bacon</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onions</li>
        <li>2 large, firm apples, cored and diced</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh minced chives (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step1</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Toss sweet potatoes with olive oil and salt in a bowl; spread in a single layer in the prepared pan.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven until barely fork tender, about 10 minutes; set aside.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, fry bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove cooked bacon; set aside.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        To the same skillet, add onions and cook, stirring, until onions are soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add apples; cook 3 to 4 minutes. Stir sweet potatoes and walnuts into the skillet; cook and stir until sweet potatoes are tender and walnuts are lightly toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Crumble bacon back into the skillet for the last minute of cooking time. Set aside and keep warm.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
        Crack eggs into a skillet over medium heat. Cook until outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until whites are completely set, about 4 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>
        Spread about 1/2 cup fresh spinach on each serving plate; evenly divide hash on top of spinach. Place a lightly fried or poached egg on top of each plate; sprinkle with chives.
