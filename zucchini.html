    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love zucchini, and it's always fun to find new ways to use it. I added my favorite zucchini bread ingredients, cinnamon and vanilla, to a fluffy pancake recipe! If you like nuts in your quick breads, you may try adding 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to your batter.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded zucchini</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step1</h3>
    <p>
        Add lemon juice to a cup of milk. Set aside until milk starts to curdle, 5 to 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Pour in curdled milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir with a spoon or whisk until the batter is just combined. Add shredded zucchini and mix until well incorporated.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned, about 2 more minutes.
