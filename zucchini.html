    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love zucchini, and it's always fun to find new ways to use it. I added my favorite zucchini bread ingredients, cinnamon and vanilla, to a fluffy pancake recipe! If you like nuts in your quick breads, you may try adding 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to your batter.</p>
